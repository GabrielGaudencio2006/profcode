        They say, oh my God I see the way you shine<br>
        Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine<br>
        You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by<br>
        And now I beg to see you dance just one more time<br>
        Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time<br>
        And oh my I, I, I like your style<br>
        You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry<br>
        And now I beg to see you dance just one more time<br>
        So they say<br>
